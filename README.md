# tts-dc-bot

Text-to-Speech Discord Bot
w/ music functionality

## Motivation

Several of my friends on discord is rather shy and don't really use their mic; they can only type to communicate with those of us that uses a mic. This introduce an unnecessary cognitive overhead for those that uses a mic (since we would be switch windows back and forth for most of the time just to check the chat).  
I have also realized that my JavaScript skill is quite rusty. This is a good opportunity to get some experience.
