# tts-dc-bot
Text-to-Speech Discord Bot

## Motivation
Several of my friends on discord is rather shy and don't really use their mic; they can only type to communicate with those of us that uses a mic. This introduce an unnecessary cognitive overhead for those that uses a mic (since we would be alt+tabbing back and forth for most of the time just to check the chat). 

I have also realized that my JavaScript skill is quite rusty. This is a good opportunity to get some experience.
